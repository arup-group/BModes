v1.03.00a-mlb  14-Aug-2007  M. Buhl

   IMPLICIT REAL(ReKi).  I linked with the DoubPrec.f90 module.

v1.03.00f3-mlb  24-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 More general cleanup.
 I changed the name of the unit specifier for the main input file from
   kr to UnIn.  I changed all reads from unit 21 to reads from specifier
   UnSP (section properties).  I changed the unit specifier for the main
   output file from kw to UnOu.  I put the three specifiers in module
   Param.  I had to remove kw from a lot of places.

v1.03.00f4-mlb  24-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I eliminated the last of the common and include statements.
 I cleaned up subroutine normev in utilss.f.

v1.03.01a1-mlb  24-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I deleted all my alpha comments from the previous version.

v1.03.01a2-mlb  24-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I eliminated all the variables that were flagged by the compiler as
   unused.
 I eliminated shared DO terminations.
 I fixed all other fixable nonstandard code.

v1.03.01a4-mlb  27-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I changed many local variables to allocatable.
 I explicitly delared all arguments, dynamically allocated local variables,
   and used real array lengths for arguments in struct.f and bldvib.f.
 I deleted some global variables from the struct() argument list and USEd
   the appropriate modules.
 I eliminate calls to init() and replaced them with array initializations
   to zero.  I eliminated init().

v1.03.01a5-mlb  28-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I put in explicit declarations for all arguments and arrays in utilss.f.
 I deleted subroutines asmbl() and cnvtgv() as they were never called.
 I replaced calls to subroutines transp() and mult() with use of the
   intrinsic functions TRANSPOSE() and MATMUL() and deleted the subroutines.

v1.03.01a6-mlb  29-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I added IMPLICIT NONE to all routines in utilss.f and math.f.
 I replace all references to dabs() and dsqrt() to the generic abs() and
   sqrt().

v1.03.01a7-mlb  29-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I replaced many of the "m" parameters in module Para with "n" parameters
   and variables in Param.

v1.03.01a8-mlb  29-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I eliminated module Para.  I moved some to Param and also renamed some
   to start with "n" instead of "m".
 I eliminated some unused variables I found.
 I eliminated module TwDist and all its variables.
 I renamed Alloc2 to Alloc3 and created an Alloc2 to allocate the arrays
   based upon n_secs (module Struc).

v1.03.01a9-mlb  29-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I removed all the alpha comments.

v1.03.01b1-mlb  29-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I added IMPLICIT NONE to the main program and started getting differnt
   answers because I changed lag_iner_mult to a REAL, as it should have
   been all along.
 I deleted some more unused variables.

v1.03.01b2-mlb  31-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I eliminated more unused variables in the main routine.
 I recreated the project for the compiler because it seemed to want to
   rebuild too much when rebuilding.
 I checked the new warning messages and found one for checking arguments.
   It showed me that we were calling checkp with four arguments although
   the routine had only three.  I eliminated the second string from the
   calls.
 In the interpolation of twx, the do loop went from 1 to n_sec, but the
   code tested for sec_loc(isec+1), which exceeds the bounds.  I changed
   the loop to go only to n_sec-1.
 I redid how the gaussian points are generated for time and spatial
   integration.  I now check the number of points for each case and pass
   that number to the routines that generate them.  This eliminated the
   the problem with the length of the arrays being different in the
   calling routine and subroutine.

v1.03.01b2-mlb  31-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 All routines are now 100% free of implicit typing.  All arguments have
   INTENTs declared.

v1.03.01b3-mlb  31-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I removed alpha comments.
 I sorted variable declarations.
 I indented comments in prep for converting to free-form format.

v1.03.01b4-mlb  31-Aug-2007  M. Buhl
 I converted utilss.f to free-form Fortran and renamed it to utilss.f90.
 I eliminated all statement numbers in BModes.f.
 I converted Bmodes.f to free-form Fortran and renamed it to Bmodes.f90.

v1.03.01c1-mlb  04-Sep-2007  M. Buhl
 I used PiConsts.
 I used ReadVar(), etc.

v1.03.01c2-mlb  04-Sep-2007  M. Buhl
 I replaced x.xxd0 with x.xx.
 I eliminated statement labels in bldvib.f.

v1.03.01c3-mlb  04-Sep-2007  M. Buhl
 I deleted previous alpha comments from bldvib.f.
 I converted bldvib.f to freeform and renamed the file to BldVib.f90.
 I changed the old-fashioned usage of .eq., etc. with ==, etc.
 I eliminated statement labels in struct.f.

v1.03.01c4-mlb  04-Sep-2007  M. Buhl
 I deleted previous alpha comments from struct.f.
 I converted struct.f to freeform and renamed the file to Struct.f90.

v1.03.01c5-mlb  05-Sep-2007  M. Buhl
 I modified the NWTC Library to rename Abort() to ProgAbort() and Warn()
   to ProgWarn().  I eliminated the ProgAbort routine I had temporarily
   added to BModes.
 I added echo processing for input files.

v1.03.01d-gsb  ??-Sep-2007  G. Bir
   Eliminated checkp
   Convert STOP to CALL ProgAbort
   Eliminated unused options for Gaussian points

To Do:
   In utilss.f, use matrix routines to do some of the work.
   Convert math.f to free form.
   Update ReadVar descriptions.
   Regroup variables in modules.
   Eliminate blocks of code that will never be used.
   Put subroutines into modules.  It may improve optimization.
   Add more test files (after upgrating BModes for platform and elastic foundation)
