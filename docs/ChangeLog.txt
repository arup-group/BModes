 We Converted all *.f files but math.f to free-form Fortran and renamed the files to
   *.f90.
 We modernized the program and made it mostly compatible with Fortran 2003:
   Eliminated all the GOTOs we could.
   Used matrix operations instead of many loops.
   Converted all COMMON blocks to Modules.
   Eliminated all INCLUDE files.
   Eliminated unused code.
   Converted to IMPLICIT NONE.
   Changed lag_iner_mult to a REAL, as it should have been all along.
   Converted much of the code to using the NWTC Library.
   Added Echo of input parameters.
   Used dynamic allocation for all arrays that depend on input parameters.
   Cleaned up subroutine interfaces.
   All dummy arguments now have INTENTs.
